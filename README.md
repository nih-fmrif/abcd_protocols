Documentation of the scan protocols used to collect the ABCD data.

This files were provided by Joshua Kuperman on December 18th 2018. We provide them here for the community's reference, but NIH FMRIF is not accociated with the ABCD study. With regard to future imaging studies, it should be noted that while these files provide detailed information about the protocol, new sites that wish to scan the ABCD protocol should contact the appropriate vendor for their site to see if any additional hardware or software is required.
